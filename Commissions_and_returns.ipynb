    "## Mefizim Commission\n",
    "### Business process\n",
    "1. Customers of type \"Distributor\" are the Osem customers that purchase the product of Osem (distribution channel 06, 08) and sell the product to end customer which can be or not be a direct Osem customer. \n",
    "2. Distributor can purchase and deliver the product to their own stock or just be a mediator with no real stock on their side. If the latter, the customer of Osem is the distributor but the delivery is performed to address of end customer.\n",
    "3. For each purchase, no matter what customer type it is, distributor is supposed to get a commission and a discount (return). The payment of commission and discounts is monthly with the reference to the performance of previous month. The commission % depends on the customer type, cluster (customer group), type of product (Product Hierarchy).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "### Inbound data \n",
    "* SAP represented by DB tables: `sap_extraction_prod.vbrk` / `vbrp` (invoices headers / invoices details), `mirror_snowflake.dev_mdh_knvp_v` (details about customers), `sap_extraction_prod.knvv` (details about customers), `sap_extraction_prod.bkpf` (billing documents)\n",
    "* Pocketlink represented by DB tables `chp.sales_extract` (sales to distributor customers), `bo_interfaces.g_clients` (repository of customers in pocketlink) <br>\n",
    "### Details of the process\n",
    "<br> **Types of data:**\n",
    "Direct sales (GD): Sales to all the direct customers of Osem that are operated by Sales Employee of Mefiz. <br>\n",
    "Distributor sales (HI): sales of the distributor to his end customers / Osem customers (= Total sales of all distributors sales employees) <br>\n",
    "Stock (GP+GB+HB): Remaining stock by the end of month. Calculated as Gross purchase of the distributor (GP) excluding B2B purchase (GB) and minus all distributor sales within the month (HB).  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Transformation steps:**\n",
    "1. Create auxiliary tables:\n",
    "* vw_dist_customer - list of distributors with correspondant sales employee, customer number, payer number. Key fields: code_mefiz + sales_employee + customer + payer (unique)\n",
    "* vw_company_customer - only direct customers (type GD) for each distributor. Columns Code_mefiz, Payer, Customer, CCompany, chnl, sales_employee_code refer to the distributor; columns Direct_customer, Direct_cust_payer, DC_chnl refer to the direct customer of distributor. The relation comes from the sales employee of the distributor which makes of the profile of the distributor and the direct customers as well. Key fields: code_mefiz + payer + customer + sales_emplyee + Direct_customer + Direct_cust_payer\n",
    "* vw_customer_group - customer groups that come from different sources: crm_table for distribution channel 06 and g_clients table for distribution channel 08. Key field: customer, payer\n",
    "2. Create tables for each type of data:\n",
    "* GP: Gross Purchase from VBRK / VBRP - only transactions (purchase, returns) with type F2, S2, RE  for distributors from vw_dist_customer (list of distributors)\n",
    "* GB: Gross B2B from VBRK/VBRP - only transactions (purchase, returns) with type ZL2Q and ZG2Q (debit distributor and credit customer or debit customer and credit distributor), transaction customer/payer is distributor themself.\n",
    "* GD: Gross Direct customer sales from VBRK/VBRP - transactions (purchase, returns) of all types that are performed by direct customers of OSEM (vw_company_customer list)\n",
    "* HI: Distributor sales from Pocketlink (chp.sales_extract) - sales & returns + mekubaim + discounts of the distributor to their end clients (including sales w/o involving distributor's warehouses)  \n",
    "* HB: Sales from Pocketlink (chp.sales_extract) - sales & returns as a credit to Osem company <br>\n",
    "Validity period: from the last day of previous month till today.\n",
    "3. Aggregate all the data types into one dataset `total_monthly` and add calculated columns *Discount*, *Commission* based on the tables with percents: `bo_interfaces.bg_percents_2024`, `bo_interfaces.ia_percents_2024`\n",
    "4. Merge (Insert) data into the table with historical data."
